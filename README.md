 SOC Dashboard Gallery

This gallery presents the five Splunk dashboards I built for a simulated SOC environment.  
Each visual uses **custom SPL queries** to analyse, map, and forecast activity across multiple log sources.

|  Honeypot |  Linux Authentication |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![Honeypot Dashboard](dashboards/honeypot.png) | ![Linux Authentication Dashboard](dashboards/linux_auth.png) |
| *Mapped reconnaissance and botnet attack patterns across London & Singapore honeypots, classified by type and severity.* | *Analysed successful vs failed logins, top users and IPs, and geo-located brute-force attempts worldwide.* |

|  Apache Web Server |  Firewall Threat Analysis |
|:--:|:--:|
| ![Apache Dashboard](dashboards/apache.png) | ![Firewall Dashboard](dashboards/firewall.png) |
| *Tracked access behaviour, response code trends, and geographic distribution of client requests to detect scanning activity.* | *Classified allowed vs denied traffic, analysed high-risk ports, and visualised firewall throughput to identify suspicious patterns.* |

|  IDS Threat Monitoring (TII-SSRC-23) |
|:--:|
| ![IDS Dashboard](dashboards/ids_tii_ssrc23.png) |
| *Detected attack subtypes, applied spike detection via `streamstats`, and forecasted 24-hour malicious traffic trends with `predict`.* |
